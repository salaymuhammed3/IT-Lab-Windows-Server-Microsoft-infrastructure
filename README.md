# Enterprise Windows Server Infrastructure Lab

# Project Overview
This repository documents the end-to-end deployment of a Windows Server environment, designed to mimic real-world corporate infrastructure standards. The project focuses on the practical application of Active Directory, DNS, Group Policy Management, and other core SysAdmin tools.

The goal is to simulate a production-ready environment, emphasizing security, organized hierarchy, and scalability.

# Key Features & Skills
- Enterprise Architecture:Implementation of industry-standard Organizational Unit (OU) structures and Group Policy Object (GPO) hierarchies.
- Identity Management: Configuration of users, groups, and permissions within Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- Network Services: Setup and management of DNS and DHCP services.
- Troubleshooting Logs: A dedicated section detailing real-world errors encountered during deployment and the specific methodologies used to resolve them, demonstrating analytical problem-solving skills.

# Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution
A key component of this lab is the documentation of real-world troubleshooting scenarios. During the deployment, I encountered and resolved various configuration errors and service failures, mirroring the challenges of a live enterprise environment.

Documented resolutions include:
- Root Cause Analysis: Identifying the underlying cause of service failures (e.g., DNS misconfigurations, GPO application failures).
- remediation Steps: Detailed logs of the specific commands and configuration changes used to fix issues.
- Technical Adaptability: Demonstrating quick technical thinking to research, test, and implement fixes without disrupting the broader environment.

See the "Troubleshooting" folder for detailed case studies of specific errors and their solutions.
