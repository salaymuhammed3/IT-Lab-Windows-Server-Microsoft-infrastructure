# IT HomeLab : Windows Server & Microsoft Infrastructure
Documented enterprise-style Windows Server and Microsoft infrastructure home lab

These labs display/demonsatrte my progression in getting an enterprise-style windows server setup, with all OU's and GPOS setup and configured like they would be in a live enterprise

I also have added areas where I had to troubelshoot when running into errors or misconfiguration, demostarting key skills of troubleshooting and quick thinking resolution of techncial errors.
